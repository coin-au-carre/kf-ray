*Backend*

 * More objects intersections (we have to do some numerical analysis...)
 * Textures : environmental mapping, cubic mapping, HDR...
 * More effects : Photon mapping, blobs, mist, depth of field...
 * Refractions improved with shadows, etc...
 * Advanced animations renderer


*Parallel computing and optimisation*

 * Improve MPI with asynchron communication (no blocking comm with MPI_iSend)
 * "Auto-regulate" system with work-stealing instead of master/slave method ?
 * Multi buffering ? Maybe not efficient in this case...
 * Shared-only parallel rendering with Open MP for multicore computers
 * Octree to optimize computing
 * Monte-Carlo method and stochatic anti-aliasing

*GUI*

 * KFR Editor with a nice save button 
 * Very simple 3D Modeliser with OpenGL preview ?
