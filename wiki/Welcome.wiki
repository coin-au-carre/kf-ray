= What is KF-Ray =

== Introduction ==

_KF-Ray_ is a project we started in February 2009 at [http://www.polytech.upmc.fr/ Polytech'Paris], an engineers' graduate school of the University Pierre and Marie Curie (UPMC) with Jean-Baptiste Mouret as tutor.

The v1.0.1 is the last version.
This version is shown at the end of the year.

We want to keep continuing this project because it is really interesting there are so many things to add and maybe one day someone may find it useful (we hope !).
